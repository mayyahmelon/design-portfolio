About Design course

This website is built with different technologies, such as SCSS, Pico, Twig and Markdown. 
SCSS, Sassy css, makes it possible to have a structured CSS. Makes it easier to track down the styling. Here I used variables to reuse the colors, and nestled a few of my codes to make it easier to see what is being done. Pico and Twig are PHP based content management system and template engine.
